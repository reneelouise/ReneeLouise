# :wave: Hello World, My name is Ren√©e-Louise
## Welcome to my coding world! üåç

## üéì From Economics Graduate, to Passionate Programmer. 

While studying Economics at University, I would always find myself building websites. Initially, I used platforms like Wix, Wordpress and Shopify to design my imaginations.
However as time went on, I grew more curious about how these website-building platforms were constructed using code. This led me to begin my programming journey. üë©üèø‚Äçüíª


I taught myself how to programme in HTML, CSS and Javascript. using platforms like Udemy, Freecodecamp, Datacamp, Google and YouTube. 
This helped me to understand more about the foundations of Computer Science, but also helped to build my confidence when using these three programming languages.


Following my graduation in 2019, I was still uncertain about what I wanted to do career-wise ü§î. 
I knew that I was a passionate problem-solver that wanted to exercise these skills, while simultaneously helping others but I still wasn't sure how to do this. 
In order to keep moving forward, I went into teaching Mathematics at a Secondary School, while I tried to figure out what I really wanted to do. 
After working as a Mathematics teacher for a year, I gained a lot of transferable skills such as: organisation, leadership, team work, PowerPoint, Microsoft, Excel and more.  

Although this role allowed me to gain multiple skills, I knew that I was ready for a new challenge by the time my teaching contract had ended. That new challenge involved turning my passion for technology into a fulfilling career. 
I decided to brush up on my knowledge of HTML, CSS and Javascript through building various projects and responsive websites (Check my Github to see some of them!). Once I was able to confidently build static web pages, 
I put my skills to practice in the real world as a freelancer. 

As a freelance front-end software developer, I learned a lot about working independently, user testing, solving digital problems, stakeholder management, The Software Development Life Cycle and working in an Agile way. 
I have also built various websites for different clients, including a media and communications website (www.ivymedias.com), and a remembrance website (www.peteronu.com).  
I have decided to continue learning new skills to best prepare me for a role within the industry. 
I am currently completing a Full Stack Software Engineering Bootcamp run by BlackCodHer, sponsored by GCHQ. Look out for more projects to come!üòÅ
