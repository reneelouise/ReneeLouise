👩‍💻 Hi, I'm  Renée, a Software Engineer at Beamery since 2021. I have a passion for developing high-quality software and solving complex problems.

🎤 I'm also a speaker, where I love sharing my knowledge and experiences with the tech community. It's a great opportunity for me to connect with like-minded individuals and learn from others in the industry. You may like to hear from me or my guest on the Blaq Byte Podcast: https://www.buzzsprout.com/2115341 

🤓 I pursued my undergraduate studies in BA Economics at the University of Leicester. Although my academic background is in Economics, my curiosity and interest in technology led me to a career in software engineering.

✈️ Outside of work, I'm a travel enthusiast. Exploring new places, experiencing different cultures, and trying local cuisines are some of my favorite things to do and allows me to broaden my horizons and gain a fresh perspective on life. 

I love documenting my travels as a solo female traveler via my blog www.passportpages.co.uk.

🤝 Lastly, I'm passionate about accessibility. I believe that technology should be inclusive and accessible to all individuals, regardless of their abilities. I strive to develop software that is user-friendly and provides equal opportunities for everyone.
